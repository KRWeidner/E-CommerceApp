# E-CommerceApp

## Description
This is an E-Commerce App designed to showcase how a e-commerce site might have it's databases and api calls set up. The walkthrough video will demonstrate how we created and seeded our DB and how we were able to get/post/put/delete from those databases by using insomnia to pass api calls we set up.

## Useage
This app creates 4 models or DB tables we created: Category, Product, Tag, and ProductTag as the basis for our DB. Using these tables, we can test making api calls to retrieve or edit the data in those tables.
